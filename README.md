# FlowForge

**FlowForge** is a robust and extensible Python framework for converting Draw.io (Diagram.net) diagrams to Mermaid diagrams. This library supports multi-page diagrams, enhanced style parsing, recursive group/subgraph handling, and configurable logging with error correction modes.

## Features

- **Multi-Page Support:**  
  Automatically detects and processes multiple `<diagram>` tags in a Draw.io file.

- **Enhanced Style Parsing:**  
  Converts Draw.io style strings into dictionaries for fine-grained mapping of shapes and arrow styles.

- **Recursive Group/Subgraph Handling:**  
  Supports nested groups (swimlanes or container nodes) and emits recursive subgraphs in the Mermaid output.

- **Robust Error Handling:**  
  Configurable strict or relaxed modes ensure that conversion issues are either logged as warnings or cause process termination.

- **Extensible & Modular:**  
  Designed for easy extension to additional diagram types (e.g., mind maps, sequence diagrams) and improved style parsing.

- **Multi-Level Logging:**  
  Integrated logging (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) to assist with development, debugging, and production use.

## Installation

You can install FlowForge directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install flowforge
```

Alternatively, if you want to install FlowForge from the source:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/genkinsforge/FlowForge.git
    cd FlowForge
    ```

2. Install FlowForge using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

*Note: FlowForge is built entirely on Python's standard library, so no external dependencies are required.*

## Usage

### Command Line

Convert a Draw.io file to a Markdown file containing Mermaid code blocks:

```bash
python -m flowforge diagram            # reads diagram.drawio, writes diagram.md
flowforge diagram.drawio -o out.md     # same, when installed with pip
```

If no extension is given, `.drawio` is assumed. All diagram pages are converted, each under its own heading. Options:

- `-o, --output`: output path (default: the input name with a `.md` extension)
- `--index N`: convert only page `N`
- `--direction TD|LR|...`: Mermaid flow direction (default: `TD`)
- `--drawio-ids`: use Draw.io's cell IDs as node IDs (`N65PPJ_XJzwb0lOGMphRH-12`). By default, IDs are built from labels (`law_capacity_list`); repeated labels are prefixed with their group's ID, then numbered if still ambiguous.
- `--strict`: stop on the first conversion error
- `-v, --verbose`: show detailed conversion logging

### Python API

Below is an example of how to use FlowForge in your Python code:

```python
import logging
from flowforge import FlowForgeConverter

# Initialize FlowForgeConverter with DEBUG logging and relaxed error handling.
converter = FlowForgeConverter(log_level=logging.DEBUG, strict_mode=False)

# Load a Draw.io file (e.g., "example.drawio")
xml_content = converter.load_file("example.drawio")

# List available diagram pages.
pages = converter.list_diagram_pages(xml_content)
print("Available diagram pages:", pages)

# Convert the first page (index 0) to a left-to-right Mermaid flowchart.
mermaid_code = converter.convert(xml_content, diagram_index=0, direction="LR", diagram_type="flowchart")
print("=== Generated Mermaid Diagram ===")
print(mermaid_code)
```

This script loads a Draw.io diagram file, lists the available pages, and converts the first diagram page into Mermaid flowchart syntax.

## API Overview

### `FlowForgeConverter`
- **Constructor Parameters:**
  - `log_level`: Logging level (e.g., `logging.DEBUG`, `logging.INFO`).
  - `strict_mode`: Boolean flag indicating whether conversion errors should raise exceptions (`True`) or be logged and skipped (`False`).

- **Key Methods:**
  - `load_file(file_path)`: Reads a Draw.io file and returns its content as a string.
  - `list_diagram_pages(xml_data)`: Extracts available diagram pages from the input XML and returns their indices.
  - `convert(input_data, diagram_index=0, direction="TD", diagram_type="flowchart")`: Main conversion method to generate Mermaid code from the specified diagram page.

- **Internal Workflow:**
  1. **Decompression & Multi-Page Extraction:**  
     Detects and decompresses base64/deflate data if necessary.
  2. **XML Parsing:**  
     Uses `xml.etree.ElementTree` to parse the XML.
  3. **Diagram Building:**  
     Builds an internal representation of nodes, edges, and groups.
  4. **Mermaid Emission:**  
     Formats nodes and edges (with recursive subgraph handling) into valid Mermaid syntax.

For detailed documentation on each method, please refer to the inline code documentation in [flowforge.py](flowforge.py).

## Logging & Configuration

FlowForge uses Python’s built-in `logging` module. Set the desired logging level in the constructor. In strict mode (`strict_mode=True`), conversion errors will cause the process to halt; in relaxed mode, errors are logged as warnings and the process continues.

Example:

```python
converter = FlowForgeConverter(log_level=logging.DEBUG, strict_mode=False)
```
